Wicket-tutorial-examples
========================

This repository contains the example projects used in the [Wicket user guide](http://wicket.apache.org/learn/#guide).

## Building the project

The project is a multi-module Maven project. To compile it run 'mvn compile' from the root directory. To run the examples locally follows these steps:

* run 'mvn install' from the root directory
* go into project StarterExamples and run 'mvn jetty:run' or 'mvn tomcat:run'

To run a single example project you have to install first project BootstrapCommon ('mvn install'). Then go into the folder of the project you want to run, type 'mvn jetty:run' or 'mvn tomcat:run' and then point your browser to http://localhost:8080

## See the examples on line

The examples can be explored on line at https://wicket-guide.herokuapp.com/. 

NOTE: examples are hosted on a free account, so you might need to wait few seconds before server responds.
